# Prefilled recording-sample flow

Supported recording matches in the Firebase interface on `local/stem-fast` use six steps: tracks, finding
the sample, describing the sound, placement, draft review, and download.
Supported recording matches go directly to **Does this describe your sample?**
There is no separate timestamp confirmation or replay/re-singing question.
When automatic recording identification is unresolved, the app opens the earlier
seven-step review flow at the timestamp and instrument table. Available candidates
and timing-only fallback estimates remain visible, with playback, repeated-passage
groups, automatic instrument checks and downloadable analysis details. No recording
match is required merely to view the results. To make a document from these
unconfirmed candidates, the creator can keep or edit times using the earlier review
controls and continue through description, placement and draft review. Inspection
and instrument checks do not approve a candidate or save a confirmed review.
Completed classic reviews retain that flow on reload. The Streamlit interface and
classic review API remain compatible.

## Prefill and confirmation

All five sound answers contain editable values. Instrument descriptions use
current-model, current-version evidence for the matched moments. Unidentified
instruments stay explicitly unresolved. Sample-level source sound estimates are
identified as source sounds; surrounding-context estimates are not presented as
sampled instruments. Checked portions remain available per occurrence.

Method and repetition are suggested from the recording match and timing pattern.
Musical role is a proposal to confirm or change, not an instrument-model finding.
Lyrics are prefilled as **Not assessed — add any reused lyrics**: there is no
transcription model, and this value is not saved as verified lyrics or a claim
that no lyrics were used. An unchanged or empty lyrics answer produces an export
limitation. Generic **matched passages** supplies a placement answer without
inventing verse or chorus names; timing-based intro/outro/throughout proposals
remain editable.

The primary actions explicitly confirm the description and then the placement.
Automatic instrument checks can update untouched answers while the description
is open. Deliberate edits, empty lyrics, and confirmed descriptions survive later
results and reloads. If an instrument job is already running, saving waits for
it with a visible message; no extra confirmation is needed after it finishes.
The final document still requires explicit review before export.

The optional **Sample matches and instruments** panel contains read-only timings,
playback, per-moment evidence, and ending uncertainty. It is not a required step.

## Evidence and saved records

The server owns automatic times. Paired direct-waveform, full-mix DTW, and
stem-assisted DTW localizations qualify for the new flow. Coarse retrieval windows
and PF-NMF activity alone do not qualify as automatically identified samples.
They remain available in the review table. Its expandable diagnostics explain
whether recording matching was unavailable, instrument verification was
incomplete, or the available results do not confirm a recording match.
This is a conservative eligibility rule, not a new detector or an accuracy claim.

When an initial eight-second stem probe finds an accepted alignment inside a
longer coarse candidate, the pipeline retains the coarse candidate and adds the
supported portion separately. The automatic flow uses that portion's actual
source and new-track bounds. Its instrument prefill comes from the selected
alignment; other stem fits may cover different times and are not transferred.
The coarse candidate's unchecked remainder is not included in reported use.
These intervals are marked as checked portions. Repetition remains unassessed,
and the document labels their measured coverage as **Located portions**, with
an explicit note that the reuse may extend further or appear elsewhere.
This fixes the case where accepted stem evidence was retained for diagnostics
but discarded as a localization, leaving the description screen blocked.

The screen explicitly distinguishes recording reuse from replayed melodies
(interpolations). Automatic interpolation analysis is not implemented by this
flow. A recording-match abstention cannot establish that no musical reuse took
place, and similarity candidates are not automatically relabeled as interpolations.
There is no added replay/re-singing confirmation step.

An expandable **Analysis details** panel identifies the uploaded works, records
which checks ran, and provides the case ID and existing authenticated JSON export.
This download is available without an approved document; HTML/text Nature of Use
exports still require review. Model preparation failures are recorded as unavailable
matching instead of looking like an ordinary search with no matches. Unknown
legacy method metadata stays unknown.

Description approval does not relabel timestamps as human-verified. Their raw
source, candidate status and ending cues are retained. Corrected paths record
`timing_source: automated`; the export calls these estimated timings and separates
them from the reviewed description. Raw analysis evidence stays intact.

New web cases request recording analysis only. Older records remain readable:
previously reviewed timings and explicit composition reviews are preserved;
unreviewed composition paths are marked not requested in the new corrected
document, not declared absent. `workflow` defaults to `classic` for old records
and callers. Exact description answers are saved separately so a deliberately
cleared field is not refilled on reload. A frontend talking to an older API
retains its classic flow until the services are updated together.

## Validation and limits

Local validation uses real Python review/document logic with simulated Google
identity, uploads, and job transport. It does not establish live sign-in, hosted
inference, or musical accuracy.

```bash
.venv/bin/ruff check .
.venv/bin/pytest -q
node --check web/public/app.js
PYTHON=.venv/bin/python npm test --prefix web
PYTHON=.venv/bin/python npm run test:instruments --prefix web
```

Browser scenarios cover filled answers, unresolved instruments, no supported
match, unavailable models, incomplete verification, diagnostic downloads, saved
edits/reload, background instrument updates, confirming during a running check,
and a supported subset of mixed raw candidates. A recovered bounded match is
tested through description, review, export and reload. Existing
classic-flow and instrument scenarios remain in the suite. API tests cover saved
analysis validation, explicit description approval and JSON/HTML/text exports.
An unresolved 41-candidate case exercises visible tables, automatic instrument
updates without confirmation, reload, and the full earlier review/export flow.
The frontend change also exposes candidates from existing saved results; they
do not need a fresh audio analysis just to reach the table.

A read-only eligibility check on six older private saved song analyses found
supported localizations in two cases (one and three intervals respectively).
The other four contained only coarse candidates and would abstain. These were
not rerun through inference for that eligibility check; this is not a rescore of the historical
3/22 evaluation or evidence of improved real-song accuracy. No client audio is
tracked or uploaded as part of this change.

Deployment requires the API, worker and Hosting together. Use the existing
`deploy/redeploy.py` inspect/apply process with the exact commit after required CI
passes; see the final section of [STEM_FAST_FIREBASE.md](STEM_FAST_FIREBASE.md).
Do not use the older provisioning commands for an existing installation.
